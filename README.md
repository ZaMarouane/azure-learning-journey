# 🌩️ Azure Learning Journey

This repository documents my **hands-on journey to becoming a job-ready Azure Administrator**.

The goal is not just to learn Azure services, but to understand:
- **Why** they exist  
- **When** to use them  
- **How** they are used in real companies  
- **What trade-offs** engineers make  

Every topic follows this learning flow:

> **Why → What → How → When → Trade-offs**

This approach helps build **real engineering judgment**, not just memorization.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this journey, I will be able to:

- Design and manage Azure environments like a real Azure Admin
- Apply governance, security, and cost controls
- Build and troubleshoot Azure networking
- Operate workloads reliably
- Automate common administrative tasks
- Explain architectural decisions clearly (interview-ready)
